Hi, I'm Alejandro,

I'm an information security specialist, currently based in Barcelona, Spain. I graduated in mathematics and promptly directed my career into the information security field.

Right now, I'm working at [Deloitte](https://deloitte.com) helping clients enhance their information security policies, help them comply with data regulations and assess the risk their businesses are subject to. You can find my complete résumé [here]({% link resume.md %}).
